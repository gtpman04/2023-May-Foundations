        <h3>Learn by doing</h3>
        Interface online courses are different than most others - at Interface,
        you learn by doing. You'll still get all the details about the web
        technologies of HTML &amp CSS, but you'll learn them as you build a real
        web site.

        Students of Interface online courses also receive support over Skype to
        answer any questions you may have if you get stuck. Email support is
        also available anytime - or to the camera shy!

            <h3>Our story</h3>
            <a href="https://interfaceschool.com">Interface Web School</a>
            is located in Omaha, Nebraska, and has been teaching web technology
            courses live and in-person since 2014. As a startup, we were free to
            develop our personal style of instruction that emphasizes the
            practical topics and experiences to help foster a deeper
            understanding of tech that goes beyond just the syntax.
            <p>
              In 2017 Interface was acquired by the AIM Institute. AIM's mission
              is to grow, connect and inspire the tech talent community through
              educational and career development initiatives. Our focus is to
              get people excited about technology, and inspire them to pursue a
              tech career - which leads to a better work force and ultimately
              allows communities to thrive.

            <h3>Our Staff</h3>
            Interface instructors are developers themselves with in-depth
            experience in the technologies they teach. Our senior instructor and
            curriculum author Kent Smotherman has been a professional developer
            in over a dozen different computer languages througout a career
            spanning nearly 40 years. And most importantly, everyone at
            Interface has an infectious passion for tech and teaching it.
            <p>
              Our career placement specialists assist local students with
              brushing up their resumes and connecting with area employers. Just
              because class is over doesn't mean you're done!
            </p>
            <p>
              As we like to say, if you don't give up on learning, we won't give
              up on teaching!

      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        Twin brothers Kent &amp Kevin Smotherman founded TwinFeats Software in 1983
        with a simple premise: Free software for a free world. From the
        beginnings on the Commodore 64 today's Android apps, that vision has
        never wavered.

      <p>
        TwinFeats Software creates innovative, custom web applications which
        will meet and exceed expectations. We will work with you to fully
        understand your needs, but more than that - your data. Web applications
        are all about data, and without deeply understanding the needs of your
        data, your web application will suffer.
      </p>
      <h2>Web application? Huh?</h2>
      <p>
        Web sites are static. The content they display doesn't change
        dynamically. A web application is a web site powered by a database.
        Facebook is a great example of a web application - the data shown varies
        by user and can change every single second.

      <h1>Applications</h1>
      <p>
        We've written so many applications in the last 35+ years that we have
        literally lost count! Applications like our FreedomWare line of games
        for the Commodore 64 are long gone, as are our productivity suite for
        GEOS on the C64 and Amiga.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever use WebEx, GotoMeeting, or Zoom teleconferencing software? We wrote
        our own back in the 90s for not just conferencing, but online learning.
        Our Android applications range from custom games to productivity tools.
        Web sites and web applications? We've done 'em by the dozens.
      </p>
      <p>
        As we like to say, if we can't do it at TwinFeats Software, its a
        hardware problem!
